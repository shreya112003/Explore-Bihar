                    Sikh community used to stay on the Manjhar Kund for three days. It is said that the water of the
                    Kund is full of natural minerals and very helpful in digesting food.

                <div>
                    With deep jungles interspersed with gorges and beautiful waterfalls, containing randomly dispersed antiquarian remains, the Hills of Kaimur retain their unique air of mystery. Forming the easternmost part of the Vindhya Range, beginning near Katangi in Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh) and ending near Sasaram in Rohtas (Bihar), the Hills have sheltered human activities since the most ancient times, and one still finds several imprints of the activities of our early ancestors, with prehistoric rock shelters dating to even earlier than 10,000 B.C. More than 500 pre-historic rock shelters have been found on the hills, and several of these have been found to contain paintings preserving the artistic impressions of our early ancestors. The Hills contain several early Hindu and Buddhist relics along with medieval ones
