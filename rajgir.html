                    Vishwa Shanti Stupa, also called the Peace Pagoda. It is located at the highest point of Ratnagiri
                    hill, at an altitude of 400 m in Rajgir, qualifying its serene charm as divine. Built completely
                    with marble, Stupa comprises four golden statues of Lord Buddha with each representing his life
                    periods of birth, enlightenment, preaching and death. There is a ropeway which helps the tourists
                    reach Vishwa Shanti Stupa a top Ratnagiri hill. The other way to reach this “Stupa” is a serpentine

                    Nalanda is about 90 km southeast of Patna. Although its history goes back to the times of the
                    Buddha, the university at Nalanda was founded in the 5th century CE, and it flourished for the next
                    700 years. Its decline began in the late Pala period, but the final blow was the invasion by
                    Bakhtiyar Khilji around 1200 CE. The subjects that were taught at Nalanda included Buddhist
                    scriptures (of both the Mahayana and Hinayana schools), philosophy, theology, metaphysics, logic,
                    grammar, astronomy and medicine. Chinese travellers Hiuen-Tsang and I-Tsing had written detailed
                    accounts about the university.

            <h2>Pipala cave</h2>
            <div class="infopara">
                <div>
                    A fairly large 22' high ancient stone structure (Base- 85')(81 'and Top - 81 'x72') is locally known
                    as Jarasandha ki Baithak. The legendary infamous King's meeting quarter. The spot is situated just
                    above the Brahma Kund on the way to Saptaparni caves. However, some scholars believe it is a part of
                    the cyclopean fortification wall that was built for some military purpose.
                    The Buddhist texts mentions this place as Pippala cave as the abode of Mahakashyapa, the Buddha's
                    chief disciple. As per some academicians this place resembles Xuanzang's description where Devadatta
                    (Gautama Buddha's cousin) breathed his last.
