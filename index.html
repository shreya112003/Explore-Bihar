                    Bihar is a famous historical state located in the middle of the north-eastern part of India and its
                    capital is Patna . It is the third largest state of India in terms of population and twelfth in
                    terms of area . On November 15, 2000 AD, a new state Jharkhand was formed by separating the southern
                    part of Bihar. Bihar is bordered by Nepal in the north , Jharkhand in the south , West Bengal in the
                    east , and Uttar Pradesh in the west . This area is situated in the fertile plains of river Ganga
                    and its tributaries. Ganga flows from west to east in it. Bihar is one of the greatest states of
                    IndiaMost of the population of Bihar is rural and only 11.3 percent people live in cities. Apart
                    from this, 58% of the people of Bihar are below 25 years of age.

                    In ancient times, Bihar was the seat of huge empires, centers of education and culture. The name
                    Bihar originated from the word Vihar , the place of stay of Buddhist monks. 'Bihar' is a corruption
                    of 'Vihar' . Trimohini Sangam is also one of the 12 banks on which the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were
                    immersed on 12 February 1948 .

                <div>
                    Almost all civilizations have worshipped the 'God Sun', but it has a unique form in Bihar Chhath
                    Puja is the only occasion where the setting sun is worshipped along with the rising sun.

                    According to the Hindu calendar, Chhath Puja is celebrated on the sixth day of Kartik month. Chhath
                    Puja, also known as Surya Shashti, is a bathing festival followed by a four-day period of abstinence
                    and ritual purity.

                    Chhath Puja is a four-day long strict and spiritual observance. The first day of the Chhath Puja
                    includes taking a dip in the holy river/any water body. People also take the water of Ganges to
                    their homes to perform special offerings and rituals. Houses are thoroughly cleaned on this day. The
                    second day of Chhath, also known as Kharna, involves devotees observing a day long fast, which is
                    broken in the late evening after performing the worship of Mother Earth. The offerings to the God
                    include rice pudding (kheer) and fruits, which is distributed among family members and friends. The
                    third day of Chhath goes in the preparation of the prasad (offerings) for the evening offerings,
                    also known as Sanjhiya Arghya.
                    In the evening, large numbers of devotees gather on the banks of rivers and make offerings (Arghya)
                    to the setting sun. The folk songs are played displaying the culture and history of Bihar. The night
                    of the third day witnesses a colorful event known as Kosi. A canopy is made from sugarcane sticks
                    and lighted earthen lamps are placed inside the canopy along with baskets filled with prasad. On the
                    fourth and final day of Chhath, family members and friends go to the banks of rivers before sunrise
                    and making offerings (Arghya) to the rising sun. After this ritual, devotees break their fast and
                    distribute Prasad to neighbors and relatives.

                    The process of painting and the use of natural dyes and pigments provide an eye-catching finish to
                    these paintings. Traditionally, the painting was done on freshly plastered mud walls and floors of
                    huts; but over the years it has moved to varied mediums including cloths, handmade papers, and
                    canvas. Madhubani Painting is done with fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks, using
                    natural dyes and pigments, and is characterized by eye-catching geometrical patterns. This is a
                    unique craft, handcrafted by artisans. Madhubani Painting provides livelihood support to about
                    20000-25000 artisan’s family on regular basis in Madhubani district and other places of Bihar

                    Litti is a main-course dish that forms a part of Bihari cuisine.

                    It is nothing, but wheat flour cake that has been salted and baked. Litti is filled with sattu
                    (fried gram flour) and some special spices and served with ghee. Litti is similar to Bati in
                    appearance but there is a little difference. Litti is best eaten with brinjal bharta or mashed
                    potato. Litti-Chokha is now making its presence internationally.

                    Chanakya ( IAST: Cāṇakya, pronunciationⓘ; 375–283 BCE) was an ancient Indian polymath who was active
                    as a teacher, author, strategist, philosopher, economist, jurist, and royal advisor. He is
                    traditionally identified as Kauṭilya or Vishnugupta, who authored the ancient Indian political
                    treatise, the Arthashastra,[3] a text dated to roughly between the fourth century BCE and the third
                    century CE.[4] As such, he is considered the pioneer of the field of political science and economics
                    in India, and his work is thought of as an important precursor to classical economics.[5][6][7][8]
                    His works were lost near the end of the Gupta Empire in the sixth century CE and not rediscovered
                    until the early 20th century. Around 321 BCE, Chanakya assisted the first Mauryan emperor
                    Chandragupta in his rise to power and is widely credited for having played an important role in the
                    establishment of the Maurya Empire. Chanakya served as the chief advisor to both emperors
                    Chandragupta and his son Bindusara.

                    Aryabhata mentions in the Aryabhatiya that he was 23 years old 3,600 years into the Kali Yuga, but
                    this is not to mean that the text was composed at that time. This mentioned year corresponds to 499
                    CE, and implies that he was born in 476.[6] Aryabhata called himself a native of Kusumapura or
                    Pataliputra (present day Patna, Bihar).
                    Aryabhata ( ISO: Āryabhaṭa) or Aryabhata I[3][4] (476–550 CE)[5][6] was the first of the major
                    mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy. His
                    works include the Āryabhaṭīya (which mentions that in 3600 Kali Yuga, 499 CE, he was 23 years
                    old)[7] and the Arya-siddhanta.
                    For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he also qualifies as a major early physicist.
                    The mathematical part of the Aryabhatiya covers arithmetic, algebra, plane trigonometry, and spherical trigonometry. It also contains continued fractions, quadratic equations, sums-of-power series, and a table of sines.
