                    The temple was erected during 1787 by Queen Ahilyabai. A beautiful sacred place on the banks of
                    Phalgu river surrounded by rugged rocks on three sides and water on the fourth side. The second
                    largest city of Bihar is that ancient city which has been talked about in Ramayana (where Lord Rama
                    went to Gaya to do pind-daan of his father Dashrath) and Mahabharata. It has also witnessed the
                    enlightenment of Gautama Buddha. Following this, Gaya is a home to the legendary Vishnupad Temple

                    neck, which is cylindrical in shape. The total height of the temple is 170 ft. and on the top of the
                    temple are Chatras which symbolize sovereignty of religion.
